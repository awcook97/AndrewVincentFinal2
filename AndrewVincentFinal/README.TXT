 We've been feeling very unlucky recently. Time to head out and gather as many lucky
 four-leaf clovers as we can! But be careful to avoid the bad luck bombs that may drop.

How to Play: 
 This game is a simple point and click! Simply click with the left mouse button as many
 four leaf clovers as possible and avoid clicking on the bad luck bombs within 30 seconds.
 You win by gathering the mythic golden clover.
 You lose if your luck points go below 0.

 Bomb           = -30 points
 Golden Clover	= 1000000 points
